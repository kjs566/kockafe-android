    <!-- AboutActivity -->
    <string name="about_text">We are the first cat café in Prague – in business since October 2014. You can meet seven cats of various ages, sizes, and personalities in our café – namely Stella, Minnie, Oliver, Muffin, Marie Terezie, Noxík and Bořek. Our cats come mostly from animal shelters and they love company of our guests. So whether you are planning on having a cup of coffee with a piece of cake, homemade lemonades, or a glass of wine, whether you are planning on reading your favourite book or just enjoying the atmosphere you are most likely to end up with a ball of fur in your lap. You are going to fall for our cats. Come and see! We are looking forward to your visit!</string>

    <string name="cat_description_borek">I am Bořek. I came on Halloween night as a 2–3 months old kitten. I was running around Bořivojova street so they named me Bořek.\nI am a bit shy, but when I am in mood for a cuddle, I will try all positions to make sure I got scratched everywhere. I do not like people touching my paws and ears.</string>
    <string name="cat_description_stella">I am Stella. I am the oldest cat here. And I am a princess. I love being brushed and posing for photographers. I like the places to sleep that smell nice. Prams, coats, bags.\nMy favourite place to sleep will be your backpack. When I am content, nothing will bother me.</string>
    <string name="cat_description_minnie">I am the second youngest cat here. I came in 2015. I was rescued from a building site where I was living in a hole in the ground. I am quite happy alone, but i like getting my belly scratched. I also love the poaches and I know how to ask for them. I am great at begging for food.\nYou can tell the difference between me nad Nox by less white hair on my chest and different color of my eyes.</string>
    <string name="cat_description_noxik">I am Nox. I am the first adopted cat. I am very cuddly and greedy. I have already had problems with my tummy twice, because I would just eat everything.\nI am very patient  and I am always in good mood. I like getting my paws stroked gently.</string>
    <string name="cat_description_oliver">I am Oliver, I am mixed breed with an Egyptian cat. The difference between me and Muffin si that I have a longer face and almond eye\nI like to play. I do not like when you pick me up, but quite often  I climb to people´s shoulders where I could stay for hours. I also like bags and rucksacks.</string>
    <string name="cat_description_muffin">I am Muffin, they gave me a nickname Forest Gump. But they call me that with love. I am very studious, but it takes me a while to think something up.\nI like just to sit, then I look at you and say something very important. Im very talkative. I was born with one of my legs shorter, but i don´t mind that at all.</string>
    <string name="cat_description_terinka">I am not fat. Just chubby! And it is ok, because I had kittens twice. The cut on my ear is not an injury. It is a mark from a rescue station taht means, I am neutred. I like to take naps on the sofa and  by the window. I am very cuddly and I can give the best belly massages. I was found and rescued by students of history who gave me the name Marie Terezie.</string>
